Translated from Spanish, 'El Panecillo' means 'The Dinner Roll.' Rising 650 feet above the old city center, seen in the foreground, this rotund volcanic hill offers perhaps the best possible panorama of Quito. Though our viewpoint here, looking south through Quito's vast valley, makes for a nice twilight shot, too.","date":"Dec 13, 2021","bsTitle":"¿Qué pasa, Quito?","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20211213_ElPanecilloHill%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"0819d36d0c725b34017fc80eb1965543","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
