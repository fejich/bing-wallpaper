We're just outside Farra di Soligo, a village about 30 miles northwest of Venice. This region is known for growing the glera grape used to make the sparkling white wine called prosecco. Once considered a poor cousin to Champagne, prosecco now eclipses it in global popularity. More than 600 million bottles of prosecco were produced in Italy in 2018, about twice the amount of Champagne.","date":"Oct 15, 2021","bsTitle":"Autumn in the Prosecco Hills","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20211015_ProseccoHills%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"22bb3e463fda0a08f1b515c43b345bcc","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
