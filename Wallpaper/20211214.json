Today is the first day of the 122nd annual Christmas Bird Count, said to be the longest-running citizen science project in the world. Between December 14 and January 5, tens of thousands of volunteer birdwatchers will participate in counts across the US, Canada, and many other countries in the Western Hemisphere. Organized by the National Audubon Society, each local count takes place in a 15-mile-diameter circle, where volunteers follow a specific route to record and often photograph every bird they see.","date":"Dec 14, 2021","bsTitle":"Making every bird count","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20211214_AmericanRobin%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"27ae86af495d824512ec8bc8719b5256","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
