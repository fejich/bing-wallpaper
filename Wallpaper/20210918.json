If you spot a red panda in the wild, consider yourself lucky. Not only will you have to travel far (they live in the mountain forests of Nepal, Bhutan, China, Myanmar, and India), but there are fewer than 10,000 wild red pandas, and they're rather elusive, hanging out up in trees. They also spend more than half their day asleep, conserving energy for—you guessed it—eating bamboo leaves. They spend a whopping 13 hours a day eating.","date":"Sep 18, 2021","bsTitle":"Hanging out on a limb","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20210918_Firefox%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"b24703f57c6083486fd0acec05c8d199","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
