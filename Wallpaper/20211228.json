Kjell Henriksen Observatory is named for a Norwegian scientist whose research focused on the polar lights. The aurora borealis is frequently seen here, deep within the Arctic Circle in Norway's remote Svalbard territory. And the observatory is specially designed to observe the aurora. Since it opened in 2008, the observatory has become a destination for atmospheric scientists, who can rent one of these 30 glass-topped rooms built to house high-end optical instruments.","date":"Dec 28, 2021","bsTitle":"Studying the skies in Svalbard","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20211228_KjellHenriksen%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"ab48bcac459bb76ddae8fd0e602cd80b","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
