The unusual prop has practical origins. The Zuni people have thrived in the Zuni River Valley in New Mexico for 4,000 years, and their handmade clay ollas have long been used to store food and water. A practical—if tricky—way for a Zuni woman to carry a heavy jar of water back home was to balance it on her head. Over time, the women began incorporating this skill into their dances, thus the formation of the Zuni Olla Maidens.","date":"Nov 26, 2021","bsTitle":"Preserving a 4,000-year-old culture","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20211126_ZuniOlla%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":false,"hsh":"f21aca7701cea73d467f6706c21c63b3","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
