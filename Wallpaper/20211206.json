The diagram in our photo today shows the plans for the inner workings of Babbage's mechanical computer. Construction was difficult and expensive, given the precision required for the crafted metal parts, so Babbage tinkered on his own but died before he saw his vision realized. Engineers have since built working models of Babbage's machine.","date":"Dec 6, 2021","bsTitle":"Visionary 19th-century technology","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20211206_DesignDrawing%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":false,"hsh":"6acf2a7a1d50ce17198194d6a15ba81f","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
