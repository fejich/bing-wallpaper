Rather than cut a more direct path through the mountains via tunnels, the road's designer chose to incorporate numerous switchbacks and hairpin turns, allowing sightseers to journey above ground. After all, if you make the long trip to this Mediterranean island paradise, you won't want to miss a thing—just keep an eye on the road too!","date":"Jan 14, 2022","bsTitle":"Majorca has its ups and downs","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20220114_SaCalobra%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"5995330f411f8d6147da4c838644d8fa","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
