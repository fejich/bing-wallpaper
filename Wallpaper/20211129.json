Rainbow Mountain's streaky sediment layers, multicolored like a wildflower bloom, were revealed by the 2010s. Since then, it's become the most visited natural attraction in the lofty Peruvian Andes of the Cusco region. At more than 17,000 feet above sea level, Rainbow Mountain isn’t the tallest peak in the area—towering Ausangate is nearly 21,000 feet in elevation—but most visitors will need time to acclimatize before attempting the trek to the summit.","date":"Nov 29, 2021","bsTitle":"Over the Rainbow Mountain","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20211129_RainbowMountain%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"c3122f2e41d075c2a77e223e2b9b0fc3","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
