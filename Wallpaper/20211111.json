It was Veterans Week in New York City, and the ship was sailing across the Hudson River on its way to participate in the events. Every year on November 11 we celebrate Veterans Day and honor all service members living or dead, including these sailors. There are currently around 19 million living veterans and 1.3 million active service members in the US.","date":"Nov 11, 2021","bsTitle":"Honoring our veterans","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20211111_Veterans2021%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"5b2d6a6f5d8bfe86989d0bb1e370a54a","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
