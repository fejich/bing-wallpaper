The 16,000-square-foot fresco is titled 'Un Nouveau Souffle' (A New Breath) and depicts a child blowing clouds toward the horizon. It was created by French-Swiss artist Saype—real name Guillaume Legros—who is known for his grassy graffiti around the world. The eco-friendly artist uses biodegradable paints made from natural pigments such as coal and chalk, so by the time you read this, his land art will have already disappeared into the soil.","date":"Nov 20, 2021","bsTitle":"'A New Breath'","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20211120_NewBreath%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":false,"hsh":"029eda2f41b5b1d400b91a45629e002c","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
