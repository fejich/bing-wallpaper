The last time the sea arch looked as it does in this image was May 17, 2021. That's when it collapsed due to natural erosion and became a pile of rubble between what is now two pillars.  Some locals and scientists have renamed the rock formation the 'Pillars of Evolution,' a nod to Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection.","date":"Feb 12, 2022","bsTitle":"Last days of a famous sea arch","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20220212_DarwinsArch%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"abfaa342fcfa21cbb95bdf21231e502d","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
