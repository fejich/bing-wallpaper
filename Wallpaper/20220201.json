The storied 369th Infantry Regiment, famously known as the Harlem Hellfighters, served in frontline trenches for 191 days—longer than any other American unit in the war—and suffered 1,500 casualties, the most losses of any American regiment. They fought under the 16th Division of the French army, because many white Americans refused to go into combat alongside Black soldiers.","date":"Feb 1, 2022","bsTitle":"What are these soldiers celebrating?","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20220201_HarlemHellfighters%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":false,"hsh":"eaf33a239418fc7f357fbd38aa2e2f5b","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
