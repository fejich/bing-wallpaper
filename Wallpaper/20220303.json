This year's WWD theme is 'recovering key species for ecosystem restoration'—key species like the greater one-horned rhinoceroses you see here in northeastern India's Kaziranga National Park. These unique creatures have staged a remarkable comeback from the verge of extinction in the early 20th century, when their numbers had dwindled to a precarious low of around 100 animals. But with the concerted efforts of Indian and Nepalese wildlife authorities, the population of greater one-horned rhinos has slowly built back up to around 3,700 today.","date":"Mar 3, 2022","bsTitle":"Celebrating World Wildlife Day","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20220303_RhinocerosUnicornis%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"6f179d467d1ad097347cbeaa9404d02e","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
