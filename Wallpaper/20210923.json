Credit for this discovery inspired a dust-up in the international astronomy community, as scientists from both Britain and France claimed they had been the first to predict the existence and position of the eighth and most-distant planet in our solar system before it was seen through a telescope. Eventually peace was brokered, and credit is now shared between the two factions.","date":"Sep 23, 2021","bsTitle":"Last stop before leaving the solar system","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20210923_BrilliantBlue%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"b6ffd14470d442c2b2581234d98988f1","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
