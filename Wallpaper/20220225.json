Measuring nearly 10,000 square feet, the mural in Philadelphia's Central City District explores the work of Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass to end slavery. Students and staff at five public schools, together with dozens of other individuals, collaborated to produce the artwork, hand-laying over 1 million small glass titles on the mural’s right side. The main figure is a girl holding a medallion surrounded by blue flames. The girl's middle-aged self rises out of these flames, a symbol of defiance and freedom.","date":"Feb 25, 2022","bsTitle":"A beautiful day in the neighborhood…","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20220225_LegacyMural%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":false,"hsh":"647538e093a6e7b41110100b0a2c8d90","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
