Nestled in those peaks you'll find Telluride, Silverton, and other former mining towns that got a boost from the Rio Grande Southern Railroad when it came to the Dallas Divide in 1890. Nowadays the divide hosts State Highway 62, a less-traveled byway for most Colorado travelers—but worth the detour if you're keen on a sweeping valley vista.","date":"Oct 6, 2021","bsTitle":"A valley view at 9,000 feet","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20211006_SWColorado%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"afd68b5f1db716aa346877668e6a0d0d","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
