While animals have many ways to adapt to winter weather, such as migrating, hibernating, and growing thick fur, the Arctic fox does none of these. Instead, its coat transitions from brown and gray to a snowy white every autumn. The fox's pelt acts as camouflage, allowing it to blend in among the rocks and tundra for half of the year and, after turning white, hide in the snow and ice the other half.","date":"Dec 10, 2021","bsTitle":"A change of seasons means a change of color","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20211210_FoxDovrefjell%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"3065ba889c62d85e120d14c4d55cbe95","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
