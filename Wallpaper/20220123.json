Known collectively as Meoto Iwa (Wedded Rocks), these sea stacks represent Izanagi and Izanami, the married brother-and-sister deities who created the islands of Japan and its gods in Japanese mythology. The large rock on the left is said to be the husband, Izanagi, and at its peak is a small torii, a symbolic gateway marking the entrance to a Shinto shrine. The smaller rock represents his wife, Izanami.","date":"Jan 23, 2022","bsTitle":"Sacred stones","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20220123_MeotoIwa%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"906efbe43b0566a4de66eb4efbc98b87","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
