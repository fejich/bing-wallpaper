And we mean that in the nicest possible way. After all, what's nicer on a crisp November day than lacing up those hiking boots and hitting the trail? (Especially when that day happens to be Take a Hike Day!) Of course, there might be no trails to hit were it not for state and national park rangers, foresters, nonprofit employees, volunteers, and others who forge them through the wilderness. Or in some cases build them, as with this boardwalk in the Corkscrew Swamp Sanctuary near Florida's Gulf Coast.","date":"Nov 17, 2021","bsTitle":"Hey you: Take a hike!","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20211117_CorkscrewSwamp%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"7015bc9dbf5ff413c1409a1c0dd8eba8","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
