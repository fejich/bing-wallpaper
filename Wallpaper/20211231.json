The tradition of New Year's Eve bonfires in Iceland is said to date from the 18th century, when a group of schoolboys heralded the new year by scrounging up and torching a huge pile of wood scraps. The unruly teenagers' celebration sparked the general public's interest, and annual fires—like this one in Reykjavik—became an internationally noted tradition for Icelanders. Huddle up to the fire and raise a toasty-warm toast to the new year!","date":"Dec 31, 2021","bsTitle":"Roaring into 2022","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20211231_IcelandBonfire%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"1ae690de662a7502de1e0aa0a058cf54","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
