Each winter a 4.8-mile section of the canal downtown is converted into the world's largest—and second-longest—outdoor skating rink. Rideau was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2007, and most years this rink section becomes a featured attraction of Winterlude, a free annual festival that usually attracts visitors from across the country for the first three weekends of February.","date":"Feb 7, 2022","bsTitle":"Gliding through winter","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20220207_RideauSkating%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"6661ce280ef8a32c6b8bd3252e5e183f","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
