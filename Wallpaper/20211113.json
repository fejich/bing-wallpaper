First settled by the Celts and later inhabited by the Romans and Moors, this dramatic cliffside setting is split in two by the El Tajo gorge, a rocky drop plummeting nearly 400 feet to the Guadalevín River. There are three bridges that span the gorge, the largest and newest of which features in the center of our homepage image and is—appropriately enough—called Puente Nuevo (New Bridge). Despite its name, the bridge is more than a couple of centuries old—it was completed in 1793 and connects the Moorish old town, La Ciudad, with the new town, El Mercadillo.","date":"Nov 13, 2021","bsTitle":"A gorge-ous town divided","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20211113_ElTajo%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"a2cad820b3f1f5e13fb06ae156fd33c2","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
