In the folkloric traditions of many cultures around the world, these highly adaptable, intelligent birds have been considered symbols of all manner of unpleasantness. In Chinese mythology, they're blamed for bad weather, while Celts associated them with warfare. In some Native American traditions ravens are often represented as mischievous tricksters, while many European cultures associate them with evil spirits, usually of demonic origin. In English, a gathering of ravens like this is even called an 'unkindness'!","date":"Oct 29, 2021","bsTitle":"An unkindness of ravens","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20211029_UnkindnessRavens%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"640ea64ca8d615f8346558f9e4ab135f","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
