Each year beginning in late October, this 57,000-acre refuge becomes the winter home to tens of thousands of migratory birds including sandhill cranes and various species of geese and ducks who travel from as far away as Alaska and Siberia to hunker down in warmer climes. They stay until late February when they begin their journey back north to their summer homes.","date":"Oct 9, 2021","bsTitle":"Birds of a feather","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20211009_SandhillApache%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"09b58fb8a08044feba219f528e3b3ebd","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
