Renowned for its rugged and mountainous landscape, Snowdonia is the largest national park in Wales and home to over 26,000 people and even more sheep—the wooly farm animals outnumber people 3 to 1 in Wales. About 60% of the park's population speak Welsh, one of Europe's oldest languages, and today they will be wishing this spectacular setting a 'pen-blwydd hapus' (happy birthday) as Snowdonia celebrates its 70th anniversary.","date":"Oct 18, 2021","bsTitle":"A Welsh wonder turns 70","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20211018_CapelCurig%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"4f8e8764efd5b499bce0c6c382a4e72b","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
