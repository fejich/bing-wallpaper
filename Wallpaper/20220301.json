The women are shown in between training exercises while they await deployment to the South Pacific near the end of World War II. At the time, all who served in the Army Nurse Corps were women, and the units were all segregated. And though the need for nurses was urgent, the army had set a quota for just 160 Black nurses. By the end of the war, that number had increased to nearly 500.","date":"Mar 1, 2022","bsTitle":"It's Women's History Month","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20220301_USArmyNurse%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":false,"hsh":"43a29b2c9d098736872b8545fa602910","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
