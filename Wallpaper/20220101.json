While many of us may be napping today to recover from New Year's Eve celebrations, this seal is napping because it can. All the noise and excitement were last night, just 40 miles away at New York City's ball drop, but it's quiet enough here at Long Island's Jones Beach for our sleepy friend to recuperate in the sand. Harp seals are one of five types of seals that populate Jones Beach from November to May. They travel from as far away as the Canadian Arctic and northwestern Greenland to rest up and feed before making their way north again in the spring.","date":"Jan 1, 2022","bsTitle":"Napping away New Year's Day","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20220101_JonesBeachHarpSeal%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"9823c8603b59aad7235eb7a3d59537c4","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
