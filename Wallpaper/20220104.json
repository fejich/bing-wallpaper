This arid landscape is not the kind of dune-filled terrain that you might visualize when you think of a desert. Instead, it's a series of rolling hills, canyons, gullies, and arroyos, speckled with sparse but hardy vegetation. It makes for a surreal and beautiful view.","date":"Jan 4, 2022","bsTitle":"Beautiful badlands","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20220104_BorregoBadlands%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"8e003ec6dc88ee226b20bbe5c05a0841","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
