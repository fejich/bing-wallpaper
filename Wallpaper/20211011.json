Visitors can walk through the low door of the Clan House to see how families from the tribes once lived. The park also boasts a collection of 14 traditionally crafted totem poles based on 19th-century originals. The order and positions of the symbolic faces on the poles show the progression of a specific story that can be interpreted by those who know how to 'read' the carvings.","date":"Oct 11, 2021","bsTitle":"Indigenous living","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20211011_ClanHouse%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"cb4f95bf572e5463ff03bef2fb672fc9","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
