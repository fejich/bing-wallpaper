The ornate Art Nouveau building was originally planned to open years earlier in 1910 to mark the 100th anniversary of Mexico's independence from Spain. Even though it missed that 1910 deadline, the Palacio de Bellas Artes is still considered a symbol of Mexican independence. To get the story of how Mexico broke with Spain, we must travel 200 miles from this spot and back in time to the early 1800s.","date":"Sep 16, 2021","bsTitle":"A cry for independence","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20210916_PalacioArtes%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":false,"hsh":"82a333ae231448ad3c577bc520e2d8f3","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
