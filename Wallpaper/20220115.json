It was formed when the roof of an ancient lava tube collapsed, exposing the 98-foot-deep teal-blue pool. This is the largest of many such tide pools and blow holes formed in the area thousands of years ago. An underground cave system connects this swimming hole to the nearby ocean, and the water rises and falls with the tides.","date":"Jan 15, 2022","bsTitle":"A crown jewel in the Pacific","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20220115_BigHole%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"e294c3c5bedbdddd748be7c0b0275e27","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
