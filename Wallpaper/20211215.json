Not your typical waterfront condo, but hey, it's cozy.","date":"Dec 15, 2021","bsTitle":"On the coast of Cantabria","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20211215_SantaJusta%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"b615d32ca9ac878cc0a65770723d35aa","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
