In fact, scholars in India described the sequence centuries before Fibonacci, and they probably weren't the first to figure it out either. But in any case, each November 23—that is, 11/23—we celebrate the infinite series known as the Fibonacci sequence.","date":"Nov 23, 2021","bsTitle":"Fibonacci Day","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20211123_AmmoniteShell%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"e366a76bc34247cec1b2f635c55fca99","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
