As you rush to catch your commuter train in the station, pause to look up and then contemplate Kehinde Wiley's triptych called 'Go.' The ceiling fresco—a mix of stained glass, hand-painted detail, and LED lighting—recalls artwork from the Italian Renaissance, with vibrant blue skies and heavenly clouds. But in Wiley's interpretation, the religious figures common in such works are replaced by Black Americans in modern-day clothing—seemingly weightless in the air, in poses reminiscent of breakdancing moves.","date":"Feb 11, 2022","bsTitle":"Look up to Black pride","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20220211_TriptychGo%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":false,"hsh":"06d141ebda6ee0c4e753a81f081027be","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
