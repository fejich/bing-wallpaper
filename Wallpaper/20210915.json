It was commissioned by the El Paso Museum of Art for one of its outside walls. Alvarado began his painting career as a graffiti artist, tagging the walls of the city's historic Segundo Barrio, and today his work can be found throughout the city. This mural depicts a local musician, Johnny Barragan, with an unnamed woman, and is described as an ode to a hometown hero of El Paso.","date":"Sep 15, 2021","bsTitle":"It's National Hispanic Heritage Month","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20210915_Fronterizos%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":false,"hsh":"fdd1d08a7c587bc4816b7a7777b7903c","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
