It's made of more than 7,000 recycled plastic water bottles with LED lights inside, to honor one of China's most important holidays, the Mid-Autumn Festival. While it's only been an 'official' public holiday in China since 2008, mention of the Mid-Autumn Festival first appeared in written historical texts as far back as 3,000 years ago. Families celebrate the holiday by lighting paper lanterns and sharing a meal, traditionally at a round table. This reunion is said to bring good luck and happiness.","date":"Sep 21, 2021","bsTitle":"An old celebration for a new season","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20210921_RisingMoon%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":false,"hsh":"6acafc2c77a86c870db4b1540cd738fa","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
