Each year on January 25, Cupid aims his arrow toward the people of Wales who celebrate St. Dwynwen's Day—the Welsh version of St. Valentine's Day. St. Dwynwen is Wales' patron saint of lovers, although she was rather unlucky in that department after falling head over heels for a man she wasn't allowed to marry. The 5th-century princess's heartache led her to dedicate her life to God and pray for true lovers to have better fortune than her own. In return, Dwynwen became a nun and set up a convent here on Llanddwyn.","date":"Jan 25, 2022","bsTitle":"Love at first light","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20220125_StDwynwensDay%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"3c1f931bc9a001158f4423c4dd4e0836","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
