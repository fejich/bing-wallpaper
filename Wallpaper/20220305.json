A crude, elevated causeway built in the 19th century once connected Mont-Saint-Michel to the mainland, allowing visitors to walk across to the spectacular rock. But in 2014, the causeway was removed and replaced by an elegant, curving bridge above the tidal flats. Now water flows freely around the monument at high tide, making the tiny island fortress a real island for the first time in more than a century.","date":"Mar 5, 2022","bsTitle":"A saintly vision inspired the first chapel","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20220305_NormandyMont%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"c0147e3cc3e6c6adfbedf5d7ac8c28c8","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
