In the wild, these majestic animals are grazers, with wide, square upper lips perfect for feeding on the grasses of African savannahs. The two-horned white rhino is one of five living rhino species, along with the black, greater one-horned, Sumatran, and Javan rhinos. White rhinos, like the mother and offspring you see nuzzling here, have seen their numbers dwindle due to poaching and shrinking natural habitats.","date":"Sep 22, 2021","bsTitle":"What's cuter than nuzzling rhinos?","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20210922_BabyRhino%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"d3871737f4b7b0d8c5b9cb920927aa0f","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
